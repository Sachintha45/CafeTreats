			<p>CafeTreats was originally the vision of two coffee nerds who were unsatisfied with the quality of the coffee in their neighborhood. What started as a pop-up coffee stall has transformed into a full cafe with seating for over 50 guests.

Our aim isnâ€™t just to give people a place to meet and drink coffee, but to get people excited about the coffee they drink, and where it comes from. Got more questions? Drop by and join us for a chat.</p>
